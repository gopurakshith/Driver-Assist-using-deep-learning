# Driver-Assist-using-deep-learning
A software tool to detect traffic sings and assist the driver in situations such as distracted driving, rainfall, fog and snowfall using custom architecture Deep Learning model with 97.5% accuracy. It also acts a package module for self-driving cars. This neural network is trained on GTSRB â€“ German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.

Languages/Software packages/Algorithms used: Python, Deep Learning(convolutional layers, dropout, ReLu function, )
